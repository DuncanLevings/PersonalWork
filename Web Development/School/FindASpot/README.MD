# Find A Spot

Find A Spot, is developed using IntelliJ IDEA, and uses the Cordova framework. User 
preference data is stored, via JSON data, within googles FireBase service. This data 
is retrieved from this database, and parsed to populate the settings data within the app. 
Images are stored in local storage, at maximum of only one image, and retrieved from 
same local storage upon app bootup. Geolocation is also used in the query calls to the 
respective APIs for retrieving nearby parking data.
